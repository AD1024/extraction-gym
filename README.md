# Extraction Gym

A suite of benchmarks to test e-graph extraction algorithms.

Add your algorithm in `src/extract` and then add a line in `src/main.rs`. 
To run, type `make`.

## Data

Please add data! It's just a csv with the following schema:

```
eclass:str, cost:float, node_name:str, eclass_children:str*
```

There is a special `##` directive to specify the root(s) of the e-graph.
You can have multiple of these on separate lines.

Make sure all ids (including roots) are canonical!

### Example

Here's an e-graph with `f(g(x)) = h(y, x)`, and everything has cost `1` except for `h` which has cost `7.5`:

```csv
## root: 2
0,   1, x
1,   1, g, 0
2,   1, f, 1
# this is a comment, starting the second "term"
3,   1, y
2, 7.5, h, 3, 0
```

## Snippet

Here's a snippet that you can base your csv printing code on if you want. 
Make sure to also print the `## root:` directive to specify the roots!

```rust 
pub fn write_to_csv<L, A>(egraph: &EGraph<L, A>, w: &mut impl std::io::Write) -> std::io::Result<()>
where
    L: Language + std::fmt::Display,
    A: Analysis<L>,
{
    writeln!(w, "# generated by egg {}", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))?;
    let mut ids = egraph.classes().map(|c| c.id).collect::<Vec<_>>();
    ids.sort();
    for id in ids {
        for node in &egraph[id].nodes {
            let cost = 1;
            write!(w, "{},{},{}", id, cost, node)?;
            for child in node.children() {
                write!(w, ",{}", child)?;
            }
            writeln!(w)?;
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
